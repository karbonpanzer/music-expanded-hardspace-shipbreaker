    <description><![CDATA[ The profits must grow or else we might have to cut bonuses for the bosses this quarter, that's not going to happen over your mutilated body. However, if you even think the word union, we will find you in void of your contract and as such will revoke your usage of pain-inhibitors and our patented Lazarus System.
Your colony must grow and growth of any nation is through the enrichment of the most important colonists who despite only having come into the colony with a lot of silver, are the greatest citizens of the colony and their interests and successes will trickle down to the rest of the colonist. This however is more or less the reality you live in if you decide to work as an Amazon employee or if you're to ugly for Elon Musk to molest at work, maybe this system doens't work so well but those guys over there paid me a lot of money to say that the system is perfect as is.

Tracks:
Crows Feet, Frontierbound, Gold Digger, Hitched High Rail, Holding On, Labour of Love, Long Road, One Day Longer, Project L, Red Sunset, Roots Song, Salvation, The Miners, The Traveler, Everwork, Opening Cinematic, Closing Cinematic.]]>
